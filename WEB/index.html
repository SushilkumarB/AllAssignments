    <p>Former captain
        <B>Michael Clarke</B> has criticised Australia's <u>"negative" </u>approach in the Test &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loss to an
        <I> under-strength Indian team</I>, saying the hosts, instead of pushing aggressively for wins, seemed scared of defeat. Clarke, however, refused to blame team leader Tim Paine for the unthinkable Test series defeat at home.<br> An injury-ravaged India beat Australia by three
        wickets in the final game in Brisbane on Tuesday to win the series 2-1 and retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. "I thought we might have been a tad negative at certain stages throughout because we were scared to lose versus attack hard and look
        to win the game," Clarke said on Big Sports Breakfast.
